# ReadMe-Generator

This Assignment talks to the user and gives them a series of questions then generates a README.md based on the information they provide 

When the user calls:

node index.js
into their command line on their terminal, they will be prompted with:

What is your Github username?

What is your email address?

What is your project's name?

Please write a short description of your project.

What kind of liscense should your project have?

What command should you run to install dependencies?

What command should be run to run tests?

What does the user need to know about using the repo?

What does the user need to know about contributing to the repo?

The user should be given a Success! log and their very own README.md should be generated in the output folder

If you have any questions feel free to contact me at either Github, or malcolm2345@outlook.com
